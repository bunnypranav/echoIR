# 2/21/2026 - Ideation and tentative BOM listing  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

I want to build an IR hub, with both an IR receiver and a handful of transmitters, which can control my IR appliances, like the AC, fan, and TV, with my phone and over the internet. It wouldn't replace the remotes, but it could learn their signals and replay them whenever I want from my phone.

At first this sounded simple, little did I know working with raw components is much harder than putting toghether pre-made dev modules and a devboard together! I thought it will be just an IR transmitter and receiver connected to a microcontroller, but once I started actually researching, I realized there are a lot of small stuff to add. This is technically my first time building something without a guide, and that is not a breadboard dev-kit prototype; and therefore, also my first time working with capacitors, resistors, and transistors/MOSFET (still yet to understand the diff between).

After spending 5 whole hours researching, I have tentatively finalized a list of components that will be used, therefore helping me build the schematic and eventually a PCB. Of course, most of the 5 hours was researching, but I included anyways since I spent it and I'm not claiming any tickets for this time. I have attached the cart of the two websites I will use for getting the components, since one did not have all of them. Basically, my BOM is being drafted in the checkout page only, because I have to know which stuff I can source and which I can't.

# 2/22/2026 - Schematic done!  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

Today I spent most of my time just staring at the schematic and trying to understand (and verify) if everything actually makes sense. Schematic is where everything connects together, and if one thing is wrong, the whole board won't work.

On the left side is the USB-C connector, going into the polyfuse, then into the +5V rail. I was confused earlier about whether to power VSYS or VBUS on the Pico, but now it's clear that it should be VSYS, which is correct for external power. That part makes me feel relieved because getting the power input wrong would be such a basic mistake. The three IR LEDs each have their own 33-ohm resistor and connect from +5V to the IRLEDNODE. When the MOSFET turns on, current flows through all three LEDs to ground. The TSOP38238 receiver runs from +3.3V, which comes from the Pico's internal regulator. There is a 100nF capacitor and a 4.7uF capacitor close to it, because IR receivers are sensitive to noise. The button connected to GPIO 14 controls the "record" mode, with its status led just being the inbuild Pi led at GPIO25 (iirc). I spend a lot of time checking the schematic multiple times, because I do not have the skills to find such connection errors while routing the PCB, meaning it has to found now or never.

# 2/27/2026 - Finished routing the PCB  

_Time spent: 4.5h_  

Today I finally moved from schematic to PCB, and honestly it felt like starting over again. Physically routing copper in a way that doesn't turn into spaghetti is a big project in and of itself! Since I wanted this to be circular, I spent a huge amount of time just arranging components, as well as learning how to rotate stuff in KiCad in increments more precise that 90 degrees, all so it didn't look awkward to both look at and see. I positioned the IR LEDs around the perimeter so they can blast in multiple directions and then routed their 33-ohm resistors nearby.

The most confusing part were the F.Cu and B.Cu pours. I first thought having a 5V pour on one layer and GND on the other would be clean, but further research showed that it has a big noise problem. After spending a lot of hours routing my PCB with the 5V pour in B.Cu, I had to scrap the idea of a 5V plane entirely. I switched both top and bottom pours to GND and routed 5V as a thick trace manually. Since it was my first time using "decoupling caps", I had to double check and verify that they were close enough to their "parents" whom they were decoupling the power for. Trace width was a similar challenge and thing to consider, since I'm powering multiple high-ish power consuming stuff through the PCB.

At last, after all these considerations, my PCB is finally done! Future me will have to deal with the trouble of soldering SMD components, that too during my first time soldering!

# 3/1/2026 - Basic firmware finished  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

I spent today finishing a basic prototype version of the firmware before I actually get the components and PCB.

I started by getting the IR transmit and receive logic working., ghe TSOP starts recording on the press of the button, and saves the recorded content with a simple incremental ID. I added WiFi and a HTTP server. The idea was to send a POST request to the Pico with a signal ID in the body, and the board replays it. Right now, the signals are just stored in memory with incremental IDs.

Eventually I may build a more feature rich dashboard and option to delete and rename the recorded signals. But for now, it is just a waiting game for the design review and component delivery!
